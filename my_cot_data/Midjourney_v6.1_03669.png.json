    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, we need to assess how well each element of the prompt is represented in the image. Let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Cowboy (human)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Reasoning:** The image clearly depicts a person dressed as a cowboy. The individual is wearing a cowboy hat, a leather jacket, and a scarf, which are typical elements of a cowboy's attire. The representation is accurate and aligns perfectly with the \"cowboy\" element of the prompt.\n\n### 2. **Rides (activity)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Reasoning:** The cowboy is seated on a horse, holding the reins, which indicates that he is riding the horse. The posture and the position of the cowboy on the horse clearly show the activity of riding. There is no ambiguity in this aspect, so the alignment is perfect.\n\n### 3. **Horse (animal/human)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Reasoning:** The image prominently features a horse. The horse is detailed, with visible reins and a bridle, indicating it is being ridden. The horse is central to the image, and its presence is unmistakable, aligning perfectly with the \"horse\" element of the prompt.\n\n### 4. **Close-up (other-perspective)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Reasoning:** The image is a close-up shot focusing on the cowboy and the horse. The framing centers on the upper body of the cowboy and the head of the horse, providing a detailed view of both. This perspective matches the \"close-up\" description in the prompt, ensuring high alignment.\n\n### 5. **Total Alignment Score**\n   - **Score: 5.0**\n   - **Reasoning:** Each element of the prompt (\"cowboy,\" \"rides,\" \"horse,\" and \"close-up\") is perfectly aligned with the image, receiving a score of 1.0. Since there are four elements and each is fully aligned, the total alignment score is the sum of these individual scores, resulting in a perfect score of 5.0 out of 5.\n\nIn summary, the image accurately represents all aspects of the text prompt, leading to a perfect alignment score for both individual elements and the overall composition."
