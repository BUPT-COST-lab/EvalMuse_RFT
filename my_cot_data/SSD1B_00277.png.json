    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt**\n   - The prompt is: \"The Last Supper, made of colored smoke.\"\n   - Key elements:\n     - **The Last Supper (other)**: This refers to the scene or concept of The Last Supper.\n     - **Colored smoke (object)**: This refers to the presence of colored smoke in the image.\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image**\n   - The image depicts a group of people seated around a table, resembling the iconic scene of The Last Supper.\n   - There is a significant amount of colored smoke in the background, with various hues like green, blue, and pink.\n\n### 3. **Evaluating 'The Last Supper (other)'**\n   - The image clearly shows a scene that resembles The Last Supper, with figures seated around a table sharing a meal.\n   - However, the prompt specifies \"made of colored smoke,\" which implies that the entire scene should be composed of or appear as if it is made from colored smoke.\n   - In this image, the figures and the table are not made of smoke; they are distinct and solid, separate from the smoke in the background.\n   - Therefore, the element score for \"The Last Supper (other)\" is given a low score of **0.0** because the scene does not meet the specific requirement of being \"made of colored smoke.\"\n\n### 4. **Evaluating 'Colored smoke (object)'**\n   - The image does feature a substantial amount of colored smoke in the background, matching the description in the prompt.\n   - The smoke is vivid and varied in color, contributing positively to the overall composition.\n   - However, the smoke is not integrated into the depiction of The Last Supper itself, but rather serves as a backdrop.\n   - Despite this limitation, the presence of colored smoke is accurately represented, earning an element score of **0.666667**.\n\n### 5. **Calculating the Total Alignment Score**\n   - The total alignment score is a weighted average of the individual element scores.\n   - Given the scores:\n     - Element 1 (\"The Last Supper (other)\"): 0.0\n     - Element 2 (\"Colored smoke (object)\"): 0.666667\n   - The total score is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Score} = \\left( \\frac{0.0 + 0.666667}{2} \\right) \\times 5 = 2.0\n     \\]\n   - This reflects a moderate level of alignment, acknowledging the accurate representation of colored smoke while penalizing the lack of integration with The Last Supper.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe scores reflect a balanced evaluation where the colored smoke is well-represented, but the key concept of The Last Supper being \"made of colored smoke\" is not fulfilled. This results in a moderate total alignment score of **2.0**."
