    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt**\n   - The prompt describes a blackboard with the symbol '>' on it.\n   - The art style is also mentioned as an attribute.\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image**\n   - The image shows a blackboard-like background with two large white arrow symbols (\">\") prominently displayed.\n   - The art style appears to be somewhat abstract or textured, with visible brushstrokes and a slightly worn look.\n\n### 3. **Element Alignment Scores**\n\n#### a. **'> (Other-writing&symbol)'**\n   - **Score: 0.5**\n   - **Reasoning:** \n     - The image does contain the '>' symbol, which aligns with the prompt.\n     - However, there are two '>' symbols instead of one, which might not perfectly match the prompt's description if it was intended to have only one '>'.\n     - The '>' symbols are very large and dominate the image, which could be considered more than just \"text\" on a blackboard, potentially altering the intended simplicity of the prompt.\n\n#### b. **'Art style (attribute)'**\n   - **Score: 0.666667**\n   - **Reasoning:**\n     - The art style in the image is consistent with what one might expect for a creative or artistic rendering of a blackboard. The texture and brushstrokes give it a unique, stylized appearance.\n     - However, the score is not perfect because the art style, while present, may not fully capture every possible interpretation of \"art style.\" For example, some might expect a more polished or different type of artistic approach.\n\n### 4. **Total Alignment Score**\n   - **Score: 2.5**\n   - **Reasoning:**\n     - The total score reflects a moderate level of alignment between the image and the prompt.\n     - While both key elements ('>' and 'Art style') are present, neither is perfectly aligned with the prompt's expectations.\n     - The presence of two '>' symbols instead of one, and the specific interpretation of the art style, contribute to a score that is above average but not high.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n   - The scores indicate that the image is reasonably aligned with the prompt but has room for improvement in terms of precise adherence to the details specified in the prompt.\n   - The total score of 2.5 suggests a balanced evaluation where the image meets the basic requirements but doesn't fully satisfy all aspects of the prompt."
