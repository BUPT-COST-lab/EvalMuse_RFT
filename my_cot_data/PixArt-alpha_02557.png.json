    "Let's break down the thought process behind the alignment scores for this image and its corresponding text prompt.\n\n### 1. **Actor (human) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - The image depicts a human-like figure, which aligns with the \"actor\" element in the prompt. However, the figure is not clearly identifiable as an actor from a specific movie or character, nor does it have any distinct features that would suggest a particular actor. Therefore, the score is relatively low but not zero because there is still a human presence.\n\n### 2. **Interstellar storm (location) - Score: 0.0**\n   - The image shows a cosmic scene with what appears to be a stormy sky filled with streaks of light and colors. While this could be interpreted as a cosmic event, it doesn't specifically convey the idea of an \"interstellar storm.\" The term \"interstellar\" typically implies a space setting between stars, which is not explicitly depicted here. Thus, the score is zero.\n\n### 3. **Watercolor (attribute-style-artist/works) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image is clearly painted in a watercolor style, with visible brushstrokes, blending of colors, and a fluid appearance. This perfectly matches the \"Watercolor\" attribute mentioned in the prompt, hence the full score.\n\n### 4. **Under a raging cosmic rain (Other-weather) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - The image includes streaks of light that could be interpreted as cosmic rain or some form of precipitation. However, these streaks are more abstract and do not strongly resemble rain. They could also be interpreted as meteors or other celestial phenomena. Therefore, the score is partially given but not fully aligned.\n\n### 5. **At twilight (Other-time) - Score: 0.0**\n   - The image does not clearly depict twilight. Twilight typically involves a soft gradient of colors transitioning from day to night, often with a warm orange or pink hue near the horizon. The image has a mix of dark and bright areas but lacks the specific characteristics of twilight. Hence, the score is zero.\n\n### Total Alignment Score: 2.0\n   - The total score is not an average of the individual element scores. It likely reflects an overall assessment of how well the image captures the essence of the prompt. In this case, while the watercolor style is perfectly matched and there is a human figure present, the lack of clear interstellar elements, accurate depiction of twilight, and strong representation of cosmic rain results in a moderate total score. The score of 2.0 suggests that the image partially aligns with the prompt but misses several key elements.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis helps understand why each element received its specific score and how the total score was determined based on the overall alignment with the prompt."
