    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down each element of the prompt and analyze how well it is represented in the image. The scores provided can be understood as follows:\n\n### 1. **Custom Officials (Human)**\n   - **Score: 0.333333**\n   - **Thought Process:** \n     - The image shows a large ship docked at a port with some people visible on the dock. However, these individuals are not clearly identifiable as custom officials. They appear to be workers or bystanders rather than officials engaged in inspection activities.\n     - The presence of people suggests that there might be some human activity related to the ship, but their roles are not explicitly clear from the image.\n     - Therefore, the score reflects a partial alignment since humans are present, but they do not definitively represent custom officials.\n\n### 2. **Cargo (Object)**\n   - **Score: 0.0**\n   - **Thought Process:**\n     - The image prominently features a large ship, which could be associated with cargo. However, the cargo itself is not visibly detailed or highlighted in the image.\n     - There are no containers, crates, or other specific cargo items that are typically inspected by customs officials.\n     - The lack of visible cargo results in a score of 0, indicating no alignment with this element of the prompt.\n\n### 3. **Inspected (Activity)**\n   - **Score: 0.0**\n   - **Thought Process:**\n     - The image does not depict any activity that resembles an inspection. There are no signs of customs officials examining or interacting with the ship or its contents.\n     - The people present on the dock do not appear to be engaged in any inspection-related tasks.\n     - Without any indication of inspection activity, the score is 0, reflecting no alignment with this aspect of the prompt.\n\n### 4. **Extreme Close-up (Attribute)**\n   - **Score: 0.666667**\n   - **Thought Process:**\n     - The image provides a detailed view of the ship, showing its structure, cranes, and part of the dock. However, it is not an extreme close-up. The perspective is more of a mid-range shot that captures a significant portion of the ship and its surroundings.\n     - While the image is detailed, it does not focus on a small, specific area that would qualify as an extreme close-up.\n     - The score reflects a moderate alignment because the image is detailed but not an extreme close-up.\n\n### **Total Score: 2.333333**\n   - **Thought Process:**\n     - The total score is an average of the individual element scores. With two elements scoring 0 and one scoring 0.333333, the overall alignment is low.\n     - The image aligns somewhat with the presence of humans but fails to represent the key activities and attributes specified in the prompt.\n     - The moderate detail in the image contributes to a slightly higher score, but the lack of key elements keeps the total score relatively low.\n\nIn summary, the image partially aligns with the presence of humans but lacks the specific details required to fully represent the prompt, resulting in a low total alignment score."
