    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, we need to assess how well each element of the prompt is represented in the image. Let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Shell (animal)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Thought Process:** The image prominently features a snail with a large, detailed shell. The shell is clearly visible and is a central element of the image. It accurately represents the \"Shell (animal)\" part of the prompt. Therefore, this element receives a perfect score.\n\n### 2. **Protects (activity)**\n   - **Score: 0.5**\n   - **Thought Process:** While the shell is present and it is implied that it protects the snail, the image does not explicitly show the protective function. There is no visual indication of the shell shielding the snail from any threat or environment. The concept of protection is somewhat abstract and not directly depicted. Hence, this element receives a moderate score.\n\n### 3. **Animal (animal/human)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Thought Process:** The image clearly shows a snail, which is an animal. There is no ambiguity about the subject being an animal, and there are no humans present. This element is perfectly aligned with the prompt, so it receives a full score.\n\n### 4. **Wide shot (other-perspective)**\n   - **Score: 0.833333**\n   - **Thought Process:** The image appears to be a close-up rather than a wide shot. The focus is on the snail, and the background is minimal and out of focus. While the perspective is clear and the composition is effective, it does not match the description of a \"wide shot.\" However, the perspective is still well-executed, so it receives a high but not perfect score.\n\n### 5. **Total Score Calculation**\n   - **Score: 4.0**\n   - **Thought Process:** The total score is calculated based on the average of the individual element scores:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Score} = \\frac{\\text{Shell (animal)} + \\text{protects (activity)} + \\text{animal (animal/human)} + \\text{Wide shot (other-perspective)}}{4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Score} = \\frac{1.0 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.833333}{4} = \\frac{3.333333}{4} = 0.833333 \\times 5 = 4.0\n     \\]\n   - The total score reflects a strong alignment overall, with some deductions for the less perfectly aligned elements.\n\nIn summary, the scores are justified by the clear representation of the snail and its shell, the implicit but not explicit depiction of protection, the accurate identification of the animal, and the slightly narrower perspective compared to a wide shot."
