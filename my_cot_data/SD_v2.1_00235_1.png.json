    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Movie Poster (object) - Element Score: 1.0**\n   - The image clearly depicts a movie poster with various elements typical of such posters, including characters, vehicles, and text in a stylized format.\n   - The presence of a central figure, additional characters, and transportation modes like rickshaws and cars aligns well with the concept of a movie poster.\n   - Therefore, the element score for \"Movie Poster (object)\" is given a perfect score of 1.0.\n\n### 2. **The Rickshaw Milkman Returns (other) - Element Score: 0.0**\n   - The title \"The Rickshaw Milkman Returns\" is not explicitly visible or mentioned anywhere on the poster.\n   - While there are rickshaws depicted in the image, there is no clear indication that the movie is about a milkman returning.\n   - The text on the poster appears to be in a different language and does not match the English title provided in the prompt.\n   - Hence, the element score for \"The Rickshaw Milkman Returns (other)\" is given a score of 0.0.\n\n### 3. **2010 (other) - Element Score: 0.0**\n   - There is no visible indication of the year 2010 on the poster.\n   - The design and style of the poster do not provide any clues that it is from the year 2010.\n   - Therefore, the element score for \"2010 (other)\" is also given a score of 0.0.\n\n### 4. **Total Alignment Score: 2.0**\n   - The total alignment score is not an average of the individual element scores but rather a holistic evaluation of how well the image aligns with the overall prompt.\n   - Despite the lack of specific alignment with the title and year, the image successfully portrays a movie poster with relevant elements like characters and vehicles.\n   - The score of 2.0 reflects that while the image is a good representation of a movie poster, it fails to capture the specific details of the title and year mentioned in the prompt.\n\nIn summary, the high score for the \"Movie Poster (object)\" element is balanced by the lack of alignment with the specific title and year, resulting in a moderate total alignment score of 2.0."
