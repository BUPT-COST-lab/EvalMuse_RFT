    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt**\n   - The prompt specifies a blackboard with the text '\u03c0' on it.\n   - The key elements are:\n     - '\u03c0' (Other-writing&symbol)\n     - Art style (attribute)\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image**\n   - The image shows a blackboard with the text \"On lit\" written in white chalk.\n   - The art style appears to be a realistic depiction of a blackboard with chalk writing.\n\n### 3. **Evaluating Element Alignment**\n\n#### a. **\u03c0 (Other-writing&symbol)**\n   - The prompt specifically asks for the symbol '\u03c0'.\n   - The image does not contain the symbol '\u03c0'. Instead, it has the phrase \"On lit\".\n   - Therefore, there is no alignment between the specified symbol and what is present in the image.\n   - **Element Score: 0.0** (No alignment)\n\n#### b. **Art Style (attribute)**\n   - The prompt mentions an \"Art style\", which is somewhat vague but can be interpreted as the visual presentation or aesthetic of the image.\n   - The image is a realistic representation of a blackboard with chalk writing, which could be considered an art style.\n   - However, the art style does not seem to deviate significantly from a standard, realistic depiction of a blackboard.\n   - There is some alignment here, but it is minimal due to the lack of specificity in the prompt about the desired art style.\n   - **Element Score: 0.333333** (Slight alignment)\n\n### 4. **Calculating Total Alignment Score**\n   - The total alignment score is a weighted average of the individual element scores.\n   - Given the scores for each element:\n     - '\u03c0': 0.0\n     - 'Art style': 0.333333\n   - The total score is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Score} = \\frac{(0.0 + 0.333333)}{2} \\times 5 = 2.0\n     \\]\n   - This reflects that while the art style has some alignment, the absence of the specified symbol '\u03c0' significantly reduces the overall alignment.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n   - The total alignment score of 2.0 indicates moderate misalignment between the prompt and the image.\n   - The element scores reflect that there is no alignment for the symbol '\u03c0' and only slight alignment for the art style.\n   - These scores accurately represent the degree of alignment based on the given prompt and the generated image."
