    "Let's break down the thought process behind these scores step by step:\n\n### 1. **Van (object-vehicle) - Element Score: 1.0**\n   - The image clearly shows a van, which matches the description in the prompt. The van is prominently visible and identifiable as the main object in question.\n   - Therefore, this element is perfectly aligned with the prompt, earning a score of 1.0.\n\n### 2. **Edge (Spatial) - Element Score: 0.0**\n   - The prompt mentions that the van is \"on the edge of the hotel porter.\" However, there is no indication in the image that the van is positioned at an edge relative to any specific location or object described as a \"hotel porter.\"\n   - The van appears to be parked on the street in front of a building, but there is no clear spatial relationship to an \"edge\" as described in the prompt.\n   - Hence, this element is not aligned with the image, resulting in a score of 0.0.\n\n### 3. **Hotel Porter (human) - Element Score: 0.0**\n   - The prompt refers to a \"hotel porter,\" which implies the presence of a human figure associated with the hotel. \n   - There is no visible human figure in the image that can be identified as a hotel porter.\n   - This lack of alignment between the prompt and the image results in a score of 0.0 for this element.\n\n### 4. **Larger (activity) - Element Score: 0.0**\n   - The prompt states that the van is \"larger than the hotel porter.\" Since there is no hotel porter present in the image, it is impossible to compare the size of the van to a non-existent entity.\n   - Without a hotel porter in the image, this comparison cannot be made, leading to a score of 0.0 for this element.\n\n### 5. **Total Score: 2.0**\n   - The total score is not an average of the individual element scores, so it must be evaluated based on the overall coherence and alignment of the image with the prompt.\n   - While the van is correctly identified, the other elements (spatial relationship, presence of a hotel porter, and size comparison) are completely absent or misaligned.\n   - A score of 2.0 suggests that while the image partially aligns with the prompt (by showing the van), it fails significantly in other aspects, making the overall alignment weak.\n\nIn summary, the high score for the van and the complete absence of alignment for the other elements result in a moderate total score, reflecting partial but incomplete alignment with the prompt."
