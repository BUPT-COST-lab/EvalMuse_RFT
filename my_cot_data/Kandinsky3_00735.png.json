    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, we need to consider each element mentioned in the prompt and assess how well it is represented in the image. Let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Airport Terminal (Location) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image clearly depicts an airport terminal with travelers, luggage, and large windows. This element is accurately represented.\n\n### 2. **Maya Revival Architectural Style (Other) - Score: 0.666667**\n   - The architectural style of the terminal does not strongly resemble Maya Revival architecture. Maya Revival typically features elements like stepped pyramids, intricate carvings, and specific decorative motifs that are not present here. The design appears more modern and futuristic, which is why this score is lower.\n\n### 3. **Travellers (Human) - Score: 1.0**\n   - There are multiple people in the image who appear to be travelers, carrying luggage and walking around. This aligns perfectly with the prompt.\n\n### 4. **Planes (Object) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - While there are windows showing the outside, no planes are visible through them. The lack of planes reduces the alignment for this element significantly.\n\n### 5. **Windows (Object) - Score: 1.0**\n   - Large windows are prominently featured in the image, allowing natural light to enter the terminal. This matches the description in the prompt.\n\n### 6. **Walking Around (Activity) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The travelers in the image are depicted as walking and moving around, which aligns with the activity described in the prompt.\n\n### 7. **Octane Render (Other) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image has a high level of detail and photorealistic quality, which suggests it could have been rendered using advanced software like Octane Render. This element is well-represented.\n\n### 8. **Unreal Engine (Other) - Score: 1.0**\n   - Similar to Octane Render, the image's quality and realism suggest it could have been created using Unreal Engine. This element is also well-represented.\n\n### 9. **Photorealistic (Attribute) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image is highly detailed and realistic, matching the photorealistic attribute mentioned in the prompt.\n\n### 10. **Gorgeous Lighting (Attribute) - Score: 0.666667**\n   - The lighting in the image is indeed beautiful, with sunlight streaming through the windows and creating a warm ambiance. However, it may not fully capture the \"gorgeous\" aspect as described, hence the slightly lower score.\n\n### 11. **Colors (Attribute) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The colors in the image are vibrant and well-balanced, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal.\n\n### Total Alignment Score Calculation:\nThe total alignment score is calculated as the average of all element scores:\n\\[ \\text{Total Score} = \\frac{1.0 + 0.666667 + 1.0 + 0.333333 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.666667 + 1.0}{11} \\approx 2.666667 \\]\n\nThis score reflects a good overall alignment, with some elements like the Maya Revival style and the presence of planes being less accurately represented."
