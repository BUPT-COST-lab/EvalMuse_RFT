    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down each element of the prompt and analyze how well it matches the image. The scores provided can then be justified based on this analysis.\n\n### 1. **A large quantity (Counting)**\n   - **Score: 0.333333**\n   - **Analysis:** The image shows a large number of mobile phone cases, which could be interpreted as \"a large quantity\" of something related to mobile phones. However, the prompt specifically mentions \"actress,\" and there are only a few images of actresses among many phone cases. Therefore, while there is a large quantity of items, they do not all relate to the specific context of \"actress.\" This partial match results in a moderate score.\n\n### 2. **Actress (human)**\n   - **Score: 0.333333**\n   - **Analysis:** There are indeed images of actresses or women on some of the phone cases. However, these images are not the primary focus of the image; they are just part of the design on a few cases. The majority of the cases do not feature any human figures. Thus, the presence of actresses is limited, leading to a moderate score.\n\n### 3. **4 (Counting)**\n   - **Score: 0.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The prompt specifies \"4 Mobile phone,\" but the image does not show exactly four mobile phones. Instead, it shows numerous phone cases, far exceeding four. There is no clear indication of the number four in the image, resulting in a score of zero for this element.\n\n### 4. **Mobile phone (object-electronic)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The image clearly depicts multiple mobile phone cases, which are directly related to mobile phones. Even though the cases themselves are not the actual phones, they are closely associated with them. This strong relevance results in a perfect score for this element.\n\n### **Total Score: 2.0**\n   - **Calculation:** The total score is derived from averaging the individual element scores: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Score} = \\frac{0.333333 + 0.333333 + 0.0 + 1.0}{4} \\times 5 = 2.0\n     \\]\n   - **Justification:** The total score reflects a moderate level of alignment. While the image contains elements that partially match the prompt (large quantity and actress), it fails to meet the specific count of four mobile phones. The strong alignment with the mobile phone element helps balance the overall score.\n\nIn summary, the scores are justified by the varying degrees of alignment between the image content and the specific elements mentioned in the text prompt."
