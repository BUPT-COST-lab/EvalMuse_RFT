This suggests that all aspects of the prompt are accurately represented in the image.\n\n### 2. **Element Alignment Scores**\n\n#### a. **Movie Poster (Object): 1.0**\n   - The image clearly resembles a movie poster. It includes typical elements such as a title (\"CAPABBASLA\"), a tagline (\"PABRASS ACTION & ALL SLAVIYT PEAFT\"), and a central character prominently displayed. These features are characteristic of a movie poster.\n   - The layout, font style, and overall design further reinforce the movie poster format.\n\n#### b. **Capybaras (Animal): 1.0**\n   - The main subject of the image is a capybara, which is depicted in a detailed and lifelike manner. The capybara is wearing a military-style hat, adding a unique touch but still maintaining its identity as a capybara.\n   - Additional capybaras are visible in the background, reinforcing the theme of capybaras being central to the image.\n\n#### c. **Action Movie Poster (Object): 1.0**\n   - The image conveys an action-oriented theme through the depiction of the capybara in a dynamic pose, suggesting movement or readiness for action.

The fur texture, facial features, and body proportions are rendered in a way that closely resembles real capybaras.\n   - The background and other capybaras also maintain a level of realism, contributing to the overall realistic attribute of the image.\n\n### 3. **Conclusion**\n   - Each element of the prompt is perfectly aligned with the image, resulting in individual scores of 1.0 for each element.\n   - The total score of 5.0 reflects the comprehensive and accurate representation of all aspects of the prompt in the image, indicating a perfect alignment.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis supports the given scores, confirming that the image effectively fulfills the requirements of the text prompt and key elements."
