    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt**\n   - The prompt specifies a blackboard with the text \"Awe-inspiring\" written in Regular script font.\n   - Key elements to focus on:\n     - The text \"Awe-inspiring.\"\n     - The font style: Regular script.\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image**\n   - The image shows a blackboard with some text written on it.\n   - The text appears to be in a non-English script or symbols that do not resemble the English phrase \"Awe-inspiring.\"\n   - The font style does not appear to be a regular script; instead, it looks more like a mix of random symbols and lines.\n\n### 3. **Evaluating Element Alignment Scores**\n\n#### a. **Awe-inspiring (Other-writing&symbol)**\n   - The text on the blackboard does not match the phrase \"Awe-inspiring.\"\n   - Instead, it contains symbols and characters that are not recognizable as the intended text.\n   - Therefore, the alignment score for this element is `0.0` because the key text specified in the prompt is completely absent or unrecognizable.\n\n#### b. **Regular script font (attribute)**\n   - The font style on the blackboard does not resemble a regular script font.\n   - It appears more like a collection of random symbols and lines rather than a coherent script.\n   - However, there is a slight possibility that some parts of the writing could be interpreted as resembling a script-like appearance, albeit very loosely.\n   - Hence, the alignment score for this element is `0.333333`, indicating a minimal level of resemblance to a script font.\n\n### 4. **Calculating the Total Alignment Score**\n   - The total alignment score is `2.0`.\n   - This score is not an average of the individual element scores but rather a holistic assessment of how well the image aligns with the overall prompt.\n   - Given that the key text \"Awe-inspiring\" is entirely missing, and the font style is not regular script, the total score reflects a low level of alignment.\n   - A score of `2.0` suggests that while the image is somewhat related to the concept of a blackboard with text, it fails significantly in representing the specific text and font style requested.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n   - The low scores for both elements (`0.0` for the text and `0.333333` for the font) contribute to the low total alignment score of `2.0`.\n   - The image does not meet the requirements specified in the prompt, leading to a poor alignment score."
