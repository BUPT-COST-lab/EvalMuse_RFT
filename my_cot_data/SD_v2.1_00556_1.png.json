    "Let's break down the alignment scores step by step, considering the text prompt and the image provided.\n\n### 1. **Movie Poster (Object) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image is clearly designed to resemble a movie poster. It has a title (\"The Back Figure\"), stylized characters, and a dynamic background that mimics the aesthetic of a typical movie poster.\n   - The score of 1.0 indicates perfect alignment with this element because the image fulfills the criteria of being a movie poster.\n\n### 2. **Back to The Future Part 96: The Revenge (Other) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - The title in the image reads \"The Back Figure,\" which does not match the specified title \"Back to The Future Part 96: The Revenge.\"\n   - There is no indication of the number \"96\" or the word \"Revenge\" in the image. This discrepancy leads to a lower score.\n   - However, the design and style of the poster do somewhat resemble the \"Back to The Future\" series, which might justify a small positive score for partial alignment.\n\n### 3. **Mickey Mouse (Other) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - Mickey Mouse is present in the image, but he appears alongside another character who resembles Inspector Gadget. This dual presence slightly dilutes the focus on Mickey Mouse alone.\n   - The score reflects that while Mickey Mouse is indeed featured, the prominence and solo focus expected from the prompt are not fully met.\n\n### 4. **Starring (Activity) - Score: 0.0**\n   - The concept of \"starring\" implies that Mickey Mouse should be the central figure or the main character of the poster.\n   - In the image, Mickey Mouse shares equal prominence with the other character, and there is no clear indication that he is the star of the movie.\n   - The lack of emphasis on Mickey Mouse as the sole star results in a score of 0.0.\n\n### 5. **Total Score: 2.0**\n   - The total score is not an average of the individual element scores, indicating that it considers the overall coherence and effectiveness of the image in representing the prompt.\n   - Despite some elements aligning well (movie poster format and the presence of Mickey Mouse), the significant misalignment in the title and the starring activity brings down the overall score.\n   - A score of 2.0 suggests moderate alignment, acknowledging the strengths while penalizing the critical mismatches.\n\nIn summary, the scores reflect a balanced evaluation of the image's adherence to the prompt, with strong points in the movie poster format and Mickey Mouse's presence, but weaknesses in the title accuracy and the starring role clarity."
