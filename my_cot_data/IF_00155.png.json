    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the scores for each element and then consider the total score.\n\n### Element Scores\n\n1. **Black Panther (human): 0.666667**\n   - The image shows a character that resembles Black Panther in terms of costume and appearance. However, it is not clear if this is a human or an animated version. The score reflects partial recognition but with some ambiguity.\n\n2. **Garbage man (human): 0.0**\n   - There is no indication in the image that Black Panther is dressed as or acting like a garbage man. The character is depicted in his superhero costume, not in any attire associated with a garbage collector.\n\n3. **Garbage truck (object): 0.0**\n   - The image does not include a garbage truck. There are no elements in the background or foreground that resemble a garbage truck.\n\n4. **New Avengers movie (location): 0.666667**\n   - The setting appears to be an urban environment, which could be consistent with the \"new avengers movie\" location. However, there are no specific elements that definitively place this in the context of the new Avengers movie.\n\n5. **Working (activity): 0.0**\n   - The character is not shown performing any activity related to work, especially not in the context of being a garbage man.\n\n6. **Hanging (activity): 0.0**\n   - There is no depiction of the character hanging from anything, let alone a garbage truck.\n\n7. **4k (attribute): 1.0**\n   - The image quality appears to be high resolution, which aligns with the 4k attribute mentioned in the prompt.\n\n### Total Score: 2.0\n\nThe total score is calculated based on the average of the individual element scores. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n- The scores for \"Black Panther (human)\" and \"new avengers movie (location)\" contribute positively.\n- The scores for \"garbage man (human)\", \"garbage truck (object)\", \"working (activity)\", and \"hanging (activity)\" are zero, indicating significant misalignment.\n- The \"4k (attribute)\" is perfectly aligned.\n\nGiven these scores, the average is relatively low, reflecting that while some elements are partially aligned, many key elements of the prompt are completely missing or misrepresented in the image.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe image aligns well with the visual representation of Black Panther and potentially the urban setting, but it fails to capture the specific scenario described in the prompt involving a garbage man, a garbage truck, and the activities of working and hanging. The high resolution is accurately represented, but the overall scene does not match the detailed scenario provided in the prompt."
