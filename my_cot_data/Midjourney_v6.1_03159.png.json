    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down each element of the prompt and analyze how well it matches the image. The scores provided will be explained based on this analysis.\n\n### 1. **Van (object-vehicle)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The image clearly shows a van parked inside what appears to be a hotel lobby. The van is a prominent object in the scene, matching the description in the prompt perfectly. Therefore, the score for this element is 1.0, indicating full alignment.\n\n### 2. **Edge (Spatial)**\n   - **Score: 0.666667**\n   - **Analysis:** The prompt states that the van is \"on the edge of the hotel porter.\" In the image, the van is positioned near the hotel porter, but it is not exactly \"on the edge\" of him. The spatial relationship is somewhat close but not precise. Hence, the score is 0.666667, indicating partial alignment.\n\n### 3. **Hotel Porter (human)**\n   - **Score: 0.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The prompt mentions a \"hotel porter,\" but the person standing next to the van does not appear to be dressed or positioned in a way that clearly identifies them as a hotel porter. There are no visible elements like a uniform or luggage cart that would typically associate the person with the role of a hotel porter. Therefore, the score for this element is 0.0, indicating no alignment.\n\n### 4. **Larger (activity)**\n   - **Score: 1.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The prompt states that the van is \"larger than the hotel porter.\" In the image, the van is indeed significantly larger than the person standing next to it. This size comparison is accurately represented, so the score for this element is 1.0, indicating full alignment.\n\n### Total Score Calculation\nThe total score is given as 3.333333. This score is not an average of the individual element scores but rather a holistic evaluation considering all elements together. Here\u2019s how we can interpret this:\n\n- The van is correctly depicted, contributing positively.\n- The spatial relationship is somewhat accurate but not perfect.\n- The lack of a clear hotel porter negatively impacts the overall score.\n- The size comparison is correct, adding to the positive aspects.\n\nGiven these factors, the total score reflects a moderate level of alignment, acknowledging the strengths in some elements while accounting for the weaknesses in others. The score of 3.333333 suggests that while the image aligns well with parts of the prompt, there are significant areas where the alignment is lacking, particularly in identifying the person as a hotel porter."
