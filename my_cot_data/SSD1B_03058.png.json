    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down each element of the prompt and analyze how well it is represented in the image. The scores provided will be justified based on this analysis.\n\n### 1. **Teller (human)**\n   - **Score: 0.333333**\n   - **Analysis:** In the image, there are several people present, but none of them appear to be clearly identifiable as a teller. A teller typically works at a counter or desk in a bank, interacting with customers. While there are individuals near desks, their roles are not explicitly clear from the image alone. Therefore, the score reflects that there might be a person who could be a teller, but it is not definitively clear.\n   \n### 2. **Assists (activity)**\n   - **Score: 0.0**\n   - **Analysis:** The activity of \"assisting\" is not evident in the image. There is no clear interaction between a teller and a customer that suggests assistance. People are engaged in various activities, but none of these activities can be confidently identified as assisting a customer. Hence, the score is 0.\n\n### 3. **Customer (animal/human)**\n   - **Score: 0.333333**\n   - **Analysis:** There are humans present in the image, but none of them are clearly identifiable as a customer being assisted by a teller. The presence of people does not necessarily mean they are customers in the context of a bank. Thus, the score reflects the presence of humans but lacks the specific context of a customer being assisted.\n\n### 4. **Aerial shot (other-perspective)**\n   - **Score: 0.666667**\n   - **Analysis:** The image is indeed an aerial shot, providing a top-down view of the scene. This perspective is accurately captured, which is why the score is relatively high. However, it is not perfect because the aerial view does not necessarily highlight the key elements of the prompt (teller assisting a customer).\n\n### **Total Score: 2.333333**\n   - **Analysis:** The total score is not an average of the individual element scores, indicating that it takes into account the overall coherence and representation of the prompt in the image. The score reflects that while the aerial perspective is well-represented, the key elements of the prompt (teller, assists, customer) are not clearly depicted. The score balances the strengths (aerial perspective) and weaknesses (lack of clear depiction of the main activity and roles) in the image.\n\nIn summary, the scores are justified based on the clarity and presence of each element in the image, with the total score reflecting the overall alignment of the image with the prompt."
