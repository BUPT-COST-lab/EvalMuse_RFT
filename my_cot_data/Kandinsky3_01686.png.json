    "To evaluate the alignment between the text prompt and the AI-generated image, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt**\n   - The prompt is: \"stop stealing my prompts, in plain text.\"\n   - Key elements:\n     - **Activity**: \"stop stealing\" (an action to prevent theft).\n     - **Other**: \"my prompts\" (the object being protected).\n     - **Attribute**: \"plain text\" (the format of the message).\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image**\n   - The image shows three individuals sitting at a table with papers and jars around them. The background has shelves filled with books or documents.\n   - There is text on the wall that appears to be reversed and not in plain text. It reads: \"TIO 5OYI STRRNL POS TAN' .US7P\".\n   - The scene suggests an environment related to writing, studying, or archiving, but there is no clear indication of stopping any activity or protecting prompts.\n\n### 3. **Evaluating Each Element**\n\n#### a. **Stop Stealing (Activity)**\n   - The image does not depict any action related to stopping theft or preventing someone from taking something. There are no visual cues suggesting an activity of stopping or preventing.\n   - **Score**: 0.0\n\n#### b. **My Prompts (Other)**\n   - The image contains papers and jars, which could be interpreted as \"prompts\" or documents. However, there is no explicit connection to \"my prompts\" or any personal ownership of these items.\n   - **Score**: 0.333333\n\n#### c. **Plain Text (Attribute)**\n   - The text on the wall is reversed and not in plain text. This directly contradicts the attribute \"plain text\" mentioned in the prompt.\n   - **Score**: 0.666667\n\n### 4. **Calculating the Total Alignment Score**\n   - The total score is given as 2.0, which is not an average of the individual element scores. This suggests that the overall coherence and thematic alignment of the image with the prompt are considered low.\n   - The image fails to convey the main action (\"stop stealing\") and the format (\"plain text\"), which significantly impacts the overall alignment.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion**\n   - The image does not effectively represent the key elements of the prompt. The lack of depiction of the \"stop stealing\" activity and the presence of non-plain text contribute to the low alignment scores.\n   - The total score of 2.0 reflects a weak overall alignment, indicating that the image does not successfully capture the essence of the prompt."
