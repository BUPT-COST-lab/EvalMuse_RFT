    "To understand the alignment scores provided, let's break down the thought process step by step:\n\n### 1. **High Angle Cinematic Shot (Attribute) - Score: 1.0**\n   - The image appears to be taken from a high angle, providing an aerial or elevated perspective of the ocean waves. This matches well with the description of a \"high angle cinematic shot.\" The score of 1.0 indicates perfect alignment with this element.\n\n### 2. **Stormy Ocean (Location) - Score: 0.333333**\n   - The image shows turbulent and dynamic ocean waves, which can be associated with a stormy ocean. However, the term \"stormy\" often implies dark, ominous skies, strong winds, and possibly rain, none of which are visible in the image. The focus is primarily on the waves and foam, without any clear indication of a storm. Therefore, the score reflects partial alignment, acknowledging the presence of rough water but not fully capturing the essence of a stormy atmosphere.\n\n### 3. **Fog (Attribute) - Score: 0.0**\n   - There is no visible fog in the image. The scene is clear, with no haze or mist obscuring the view. The absence of fog results in a score of 0.0, indicating no alignment with this element.\n\n### 4. **Foam (Attribute) - Score: 0.666667**\n   - The image clearly shows white foam created by the breaking waves. While foam is present, it may not be as prominent or extensive as one might expect in a highly stormy scenario. The score of 0.666667 suggests that foam is visible but not overwhelmingly so, leading to a moderate level of alignment.\n\n### 5. **Large Rolling Waves (Attribute) - Score: 0.666667**\n   - The image features large, rolling waves that are actively breaking and creating foam. These waves are significant in size and movement, aligning well with the description. However, the term \"large\" is subjective, and the waves might not be as massive as implied by the prompt. Thus, the score reflects a good but not perfect match.\n\n### 6. **Total Alignment Score - Score: 3.333333**\n   - The total score is not simply an average of the individual element scores. It likely takes into account the overall impression of the image in relation to the prompt. Given that the image successfully captures a high-angle view, has some elements of a stormy ocean (like large waves and foam), but lacks others (like fog and a fully stormy atmosphere), a score of 3.333333 seems reasonable. It suggests a moderately high alignment while acknowledging the missing elements.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe scoring system evaluates each element independently and then synthesizes these evaluations into an overall score. The high angle and presence of waves and foam contribute positively, while the absence of fog and a fully stormy atmosphere detract from the alignment. The total score reflects a balanced assessment of how well the image matches the detailed prompt."
