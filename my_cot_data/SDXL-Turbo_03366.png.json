    "Let's break down the thought process behind these scores step by step:\n\n### 1. **Understanding the Prompt and Image:**\n   - **Prompt:** A blackboard with the text 'Friendly' written in a Regular script font.\n   - **Key Elements:**\n     - \"Friendly\" (Other-writing&symbol): The word should be present and legible.\n     - \"Regular script font\" (attribute): The font style should match a regular script.\n\n### 2. **Analyzing the Image:**\n   - The image shows a blackboard with text written on it.\n   - The main text appears to be \"Fireably,\" which is not the word \"Friendly.\"\n   - The font used for \"Fireably\" does not resemble a regular script font; it looks more like a chalk-drawn, informal style.\n\n### 3. **Scoring the Key Elements:**\n\n   #### a. **Friendly (Other-writing&symbol):**\n      - **Score: 0.0**\n      - **Reasoning:** The word \"Friendly\" is not present in the image. Instead, the word \"Fireably\" is written, which is entirely different. This completely misaligns with the prompt, hence the score of 0.0.\n\n   #### b. **Regular script font (attribute):**\n      - **Score: 0.5**\n      - **Reasoning:** The font used in the image is not a regular script font. It resembles a chalk-drawn style, which is informal and not aligned with the \"Regular script\" attribute. However, the text is somewhat legible and has some characteristics of handwriting, which might give it a slight credit. Hence, a score of 0.5 is assigned.\n\n### 4. **Calculating the Total Score:**\n   - **Total Score: 2.5**\n   - **Reasoning:** The total score is not an average of the individual element scores. Given that one key element (\"Friendly\") is completely absent, and the other element (\"Regular script font\") is only partially aligned, the overall alignment is poor. A score of 2.5 reflects a significant misalignment but acknowledges that the image is somewhat related to the concept of text on a blackboard.\n\n### 5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The low scores reflect the significant misalignment between the prompt and the generated image. The absence of the correct word \"Friendly\" and the mismatch in font style contribute to the low alignment scores. The total score of 2.5 indicates that while the image is somewhat relevant (text on a blackboard), it fails to meet the specific requirements of the prompt."
