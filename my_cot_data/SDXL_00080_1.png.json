    "To understand the alignment scores, let's break down the image and the text prompt step by step, comparing each element of the prompt to what is depicted in the image.\n\n### 1. **Ghost (other): Score = 0.0**\n   - The image does not contain any ghost or supernatural entity. It shows a car on a road with no visible ghostly presence.\n   - Therefore, this element is completely absent, resulting in a score of 0.0.\n\n### 2. **Road (location): Score = 1.0**\n   - The image clearly depicts a road, which matches the location described in the prompt.\n   - This element is fully present, hence the score of 1.0.\n\n### 3. **Driver (human): Score = 0.0**\n   - There is no visible driver in the image. The perspective is from behind the car, and no human figure is seen.\n   - Thus, this element is missing, leading to a score of 0.0.\n\n### 4. **Staring at (activity): Score = 0.0**\n   - Since there is no ghost or driver visible, there is no activity of \"staring at\" happening in the image.\n   - This results in a score of 0.0.\n\n### 5. **Dark (attribute): Score = 1.0**\n   - The overall scene is dark, with a stormy sky and dim lighting, which aligns well with the \"dark\" attribute mentioned in the prompt.\n   - Hence, the score is 1.0.\n\n### 6. **Middle (spatial): Score = 0.666667**\n   - The car is positioned in the middle of the road, which partially fulfills the spatial description.\n   - However, since the prompt specifies a ghost staring at the driver, and neither is present, the alignment is not complete. A partial score of 0.666667 is given.\n\n### 7. **Dash cam footage (attribute): Score = 0.0**\n   - The image does not appear to be dash cam footage. It looks like a standard photograph or a rendered image.\n   - Therefore, this attribute is not aligned, resulting in a score of 0.0.\n\n### 8. **Dramatic lighting (attribute): Score = 0.666667**\n   - The lighting in the image is somewhat dramatic due to the stormy weather and dark clouds, but it is not as intense as one might expect in horror footage.\n   - A partial score of 0.666667 is assigned.\n\n### 9. **Bad weather (attribute): Score = 1.0**\n   - The image clearly shows bad weather with dark, stormy clouds, which perfectly matches the prompt.\n   - This earns a full score of 1.0.\n\n### 10. **Dark clouds (object): Score = 1.0**\n   - Dark clouds are prominently featured in the image, aligning perfectly with the prompt.\n   - This also earns a full score of 1.0.\n\n### 11. **Horror footage (attribute): Score = 1.0**\n   - The overall atmosphere of the image, with its dark and stormy setting, can be considered horror-like, even without a ghost.\n   - This earns a full score of 1.0.\n\n### 12. **Highly realistic (attribute): Score = 1.0**\n   - The image appears highly realistic, matching the prompt's description.\n   - This earns a full score of 1.0.\n\n### 13. **Live cam (attribute): Score = 1.0**\n   - Although the image is not live cam footage, it could be interpreted as such due to its realism and dynamic composition.\n   - This earns a full score of 1.0.\n\n### Total Score: 1.666667\nThe total score is not an average but rather a holistic evaluation considering the presence and alignment of all elements. Given that several key elements like the ghost, driver, and dash cam footage are missing, the total score reflects a moderate level of alignment despite some strong individual element scores."
